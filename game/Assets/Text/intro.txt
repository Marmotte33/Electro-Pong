Welcome to Electro-pong, a simple reproduction of the game Pong, with a touch of electrodynamics. (Press any key to continue)
You know nothing about electrodynamics ? Don't worry, we'll now explain how it work.
!(BALL_APPEAR_CENTER_STOP) This is the ball. It is a positively charged particle, just like protons.
Like any charged particles, it is affected by what we call "electromagnetic fields".
!(BALL_DISAPPEAR,VECTORFIELD_APPEAR) Fields are mathematical objects that apply forces on some elements in a particular direction for a position.
!(IMAGE_CLEAR,APPLE_APPEAR) For instance, the gravitational field applies forces on us (but not only), and makes us stay on earth.
!(APPLE_DISAPPEAR) In our case, we are interested in electromagnetic fields.
These are two separate fields: the electric field, and the magnetic field.
To keep it simple, this game will only consider fields that are uniform, which means that their effect does not change with position.
In this case, electric fields are the simplest.
Indeed, they accelerate charged particles in the direction of the field.
!(BALL_APPEAR_LEFT_MOVE,ELECTRIC_APPEAR) This is how it works.
!(BALL_DISAPPEAR,ELECTRIC_DISAPPEAR) Easy, right ? Let's continue with the magnetic field then.
This field might be a little bit trickier to understand, as the acceleration is not in the direction of the field.
In this game, the magnetic field will point toward you. Yes, you, the players.
!(BALL_APPEAR_LEFT_MOVE,MAGNETIC_APPEAR) In this particular configuration, the ball will be affected in the following way.
!(BALL_DISAPPEAR,MAGNETIC_DISAPPEAR) Weird, right ? Yes, it is, but don't worry, physicist do know exactly how it behaves.
So, what you've seen is that magnetic fields pointing in your direction will make the particle's trajectory circular, where the direction depends on its charge.
And.... that's it ! You now know everything about electrodynamics ! (except maybe a few bits and bobs)
Oh one more thing, we have also added a powerup that can reverse the polarity of the particles
The effect of this inversion of polarity is that all the effects are reversed!
An electric field that used to be repulsive will now become attractive, and the magnetic field will make the particle rotate in the other direction.
You now understand the scientific part of the game, we now probably need to explain a few things about the game itself.
!(RING_APPEAR) The game is simple: two players are located on the border of a ring.
Tho earn a point, shoot the ball into the opponent's terrain to get a point.
!(RING_DISSAPPEAR) The first player with 11 points will win.
The players move with two directional keys.
!(PLAYER_1_KEYBOARD_APPEAR) For player 1, A-D (Q-D for french keyboards)
!(PLAYER_2_KEYBOARD_APPEAR) For player 2, left and right arrows
!(IMAGE_CLEAR) Some times, a powerup will appear inside the ring: there are three of them.
!(POWERUPS_APPEAR) The electric fields, the magnetic field and the polarity inversion.
Don't worry! All of them work exactly like we explained before.
To use a powerup, you simply need to touch it with the ball.
!(POWERUPS_DISAPPEAR) You are now ready to play this game ! We hope you'll have fun with it!
