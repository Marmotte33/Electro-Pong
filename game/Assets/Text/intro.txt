Welcome to "Electro-Pong", a simple reproduction of the game "Pong" with electrodynamics.
We will now briefly explain how it works.
!(BALL_APPEAR_CENTER_STOP) This is the ball. It is a negatively charged particle.
As any other charged particles, it will be affected by electromagnetic fields.
!(BALL_DISAPPEAR,PLAYER_APPEAR) This is the player.
The ball will bounce on it, and electric fields can be generated from it.
!(BALL_APPEAR_LEFT_MOVE,ELECTRIC) This is how the electric field affects the ball.
!(PLAYER_DISAPPEAR,BALL_DISAPPEAR) Simple, right ?
!(BALL_APPEAR_LEFT_MOVE,MAGNETIC) This is how the magnetic field affects the ball.
!(BALL_DISAPPEAR) Physics is great.
!(BALL_APPEAR_CENTER_STOP,INVERSE_POLARITY) Last but not least, the polarity of the particle can be inverted.
This will reverse all the effects presented before.
!(BALL_DISAPPEAR) You now understand most of the important stuff. A game will then start, and you'll figure more by yourself.
Good luck!
